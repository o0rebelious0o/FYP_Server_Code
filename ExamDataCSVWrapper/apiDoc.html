			Exam Data API</h1>
		<h2>
			What Is This?</h2>
		<p>
			This API has been written to wrap the existing CGI API implemented to return simple tab separated CSV data as found at&nbsp;<a href="https://exams.doc.ic.ac.uk/prog/ttformjw03.cgi" onclick="window.open(this.href, 'ExamDataCSV', 'resizable=yes,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=yes,dependent=no'); return false;">https://exams.doc.ic.ac.uk/prog/ttformjw03.cgi</a>. &nbsp;Processing of this data is done by this API to return the data in a more friendly JSON format with data presented in different requestable views, as defined below.</p>
		<p>
			The API is available at&nbsp;<a href="http://146.169.44.162:8080/examData" target="_blank">http://146.169.44.162:8080/examData</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://146.169.44.162:8443/examData">https://146.169.44.162:8443/examData</a>&nbsp;for the HTTPS version.</p>
		<h2>
			Returned Data Format</h2>
		<p>
			This API returns JSON data for ease of use by clients. &nbsp;The returned data contains the following standard information:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				dateProduced - the date the original csv data was produced</li>
			<li>
				examPeriod - the academic year the exam data is representing</li>
			<li>
				view - the data view the response represents</li>
			<li>
				{returned_data} - this element contains the representation of the exam data according to the view requested. &nbsp;The value of data keys will be explained in the section below. &nbsp;To explain, x : y is data with x as the key, y as the data. &nbsp;[] represents an array of JSON objects, and {x : y, a : b} &nbsp;represents a JSON object containing two keys, x and a, which have values y and b respectively. &nbsp;$key means that there will be an arbitrary number of keys contained in the object, populated by the data itself; &nbsp;these can be iterated over in the receiveing code. &nbsp;key represents the nature of the data making up the key.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			All exams are represented with the headers from the original CSV data:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<pre style="word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">

		<h2>
			Available Data Views</h2>
		<p>
			Data views can be selected through the &#39;view&#39; GET parameter when querying the API url. &nbsp;For example, to receive JSON data representing the date view,&nbsp;<a href="https://146.169.44.162:8443/examData?view=date" target="_blank">https://146.169.44.162:8443/examData?view=date</a>.</p>
